# Simulation-Of-Mechanical-Process
Master Course work for the subject Simulations of Mechanical Process,
Chair of Mechanical Process Engineering,
Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany (Summer Semester 2025)

# Overview
This repository contains simulation assignments focused on modeling mechanical processes such as winnowing and particle collisions using numerical and stochastic methods.
This repository is for academic use as part of university coursework.

# Assignment
Winnowing_Particle_Trajectories — Euler & Runge–Kutta Methods
Simulation of the winnowing process using Euler and Runge–Kutta integration schemes to track particle trajectories.

Winnowing_Particle_Trajectories — Monte Carlo Method
Simulation of particle motion during winnowing using the Monte Carlo approach to model particle trajectories with random properties of particles.

DEM_Simulation — Particle Collision Models
Simulation of particle collisions using: Hard-sphere model for ideal elastic collisions and Soft-sphere model (Discrete Element Method) for realistic deformation and contact interactions
